# Infrastructure Layer

This layer contains the implementation details for external concerns. It provides the concrete implementations for the interfaces defined in the `domain` and `application` layers.

## Key Components:

-   **Database Repositories:** Concrete implementations of the repository interfaces (e.g., `PrismaUserRepository` implementing `IUserRepository`).
-   **Cache Services:** Implementation of caching logic (e.g., Redis).
-   **External API Clients:** Clients for communicating with third-party services.
-   **File Storage:** Services for interacting with S3, local file system, etc.

This layer depends on the `domain` and `application` layers (for interfaces) but is not depended upon by them.
